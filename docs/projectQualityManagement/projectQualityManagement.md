# Project Quality Management

<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines quality as “the totality of characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs” (ISO8042:1994) or “the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements” (ISO9000:2000).</p>

<p>The purpose of project quality management is to ensure that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. Recall that project management involves meeting or exceeding stakeholder needs and expectations. The project team must develop good relationships with key stakeholders, especially the main customer for the project, to understand what quality means to them. After all, the customer ultimately decides if quality is acceptable. Many technical projects fail because the project team focuses only on meeting the written requirements for the main products being created and ignores other stakeholder needs and expectations for the project.</p>

<h4>  “Meeting only written requirements for scope, time, and cost is not sufficient”</h4>

<p>Project quality management involves three main processes:</p>

<h3> 1  Planning quality management: </h3>


The main outputs of planning quality management are a quality management plan, a process improvement plan, quality metrics, quality checklists, and project documents updates.

<h3>1  Performing quality assurance</h3>


The main outputs of this process are change requests, project management plan updates, project documents updates, and organizational process asset updates.

<h3>1  Controlling quality involves</h3>


<p> The main outputs of quality control include quality control measurements, validated changes, validated deliverables, work performance information, change requests, project management
plan updates, project documents updates, and organizational process asset updates.</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance Personnel</h2>

<p>A guide to Project management is a web base quiz application for the Northwest Missouri State University students. Aim of the project is guide the Northwest Project management course students in a right way and make them understand all the knowledge areas. However Quality Assurance is required to develop this web application. Each developing area have the designated personnel responsible for QA.</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance and Review Activities for A Guide to Project Management(GPM)</h2>

<h3>Review Cycles:</h3>

<p><h4>“A Guide to Project Management”(GPM)</h4>  consists of Video lectures, Quiz application,  Score Board, Forum for discussion, database development and Content development  are embedded in a complex system. This allow each area of GPM to be presented at different levels of detail in a web-based user interface. It is essential that each GPM area receive appropriate review prior to being deployed on the public GPM web site. These reviews will be performed for each of the area (that is, Content Development, database development, Statistical analysis tools, user interface, and integration tools). A standard series of reviews are available for each category, and these can be applied to each GPM area during the review process.</p>

<h3>Technical Guidance:</h3>

<p>The quality objective for the technical guidance is to provide appropriate guidance using consistent and standard terminology. Quality objectives for the technical guidance will be met through internal and external peer review by appropriate specialist(s) as determined.</p>

<p>Affirmative answers to the following table of questions should ensure that quality objectives are met.</p>

1  Does the content use consistent and standard technical terminology?

1  Does the guidance present appropriate interpretation of Management concepts?

1  Is user interface easy to accessible to everyone?

1  Is key mythology explained adequately for the purpose and reaching expectation of the website?

1  Is the website user friendly?

1  Do you have any other comments on the technical guidance found in GPM ?

<h3>Databases</h3>

<p>The quality objective for the database searches is to produce accurate and expected results. Search results are presented in a form that meets the user’s information needs. Databases for . GPM will be managed by MySQL. Database queries will be performed using MySQL queries Java or Javascript. Quiz question and and videos will be presented in the user's browsers in an HTML table</p>

<p>The quality expectations of the databases will be assessed by answering each of the following questions:</p>

1  Are the database search results appropriate and accurate given the user input?
1  Do the database search results appear to be comprehensive given the database disclaimer?
1  Is the presentation of results user friendly?
1  Are hyperlinks in the results table active and appropriate?
1  Do you have any other comments on the databases found in GPM?
