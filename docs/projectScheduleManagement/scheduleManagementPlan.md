<h2>Project Schedule Management</h2>

<p>This section identifies the list of Schedule Management processes, activities, and tasks that will be defined and implemented to establish and manage the project schedule. The identified Schedule Management processes include, but are not limited to:<p>

1.  <h3>Develop Project Schedule :–</h3>    An integrated process consisting of defining activities, sequences, and required resources to complete the project deliverables.
1.  <h3>Monitor and Control Schedule :–</h3>   The process of monitoring and reporting on the progress of project activities as well as managing progress and changes to the schedule baseline to achieve project objectives. If necessary, based on factors such as project size and complexity, the process may be broken down into sub-processes. For example:
1.  <h3>Schedule Activity and Progress Updates :–</h3>   The process of establishing how and at what intervals project activity and progress updates will be collected during the project.
1.  <h3>Schedule Monitoring :–</h3>   The process of establishing how schedule progress updates are compared to the schedule baseline.
1.  <h3>Schedule Control :– </h3>  The process of establishing the control tools and techniques for how the schedule will be managed and how changes will be addressed.
1.  <h3>Schedule Reporting :– </h3>  The process of defining what schedule reporting metrics and reports are necessary for the project, at what intervals reporting should occur, and to what audiences.


<h2>Schedule Monitoring</h2>

<p>Project team members will report task progress on daily basis to the Project Manager. The Project Scheduler will update the project schedule with daily actuals of team member effort and inform the Project Manager of the overall condition of the project schedule in terms of variance from planned. The Project Scheduler will also report on positive or negative trends regarding schedule performance. </p>


<h2>Schedule Controlling</h2>


The Critical Path Method will be used for schedule control. The Project Manager will review the critical path:
1.  Monthly
1.  When a new baseline is required
1.  When entering a new project phase
1.  When mitigating schedule-related risks
1.  As needed to ensure the critical path is maintained
