## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) **Scheduling Sprints**
# 5. **Project Cost Management**

-  To create the Plan Cost Management, necessary inputs are required such as Project Management Plan, Project Charter, Enterprise Environmental factors and Organizational Process.  
-  The main advantage of this process is that it gives guidance as well as direction on how the project costs should be managed all throughout the implementation of the project.

<h4>Project Cost Management Process:</h4>


1.	Planning Cost Management
1.	Estimating the Costs
1.	Determining the Budgets
1.	Controlling the cost


<h4>Cost Management Plan includes following </h4>

<h4>Level of accuracy: </h4> 

-  Activity cost is rounded to nearest values for better calculations. 
-  Level of accuracy for activity cost and contingency funds is 90 percent. 

<h4>Units of measure:</h4>  

-  In this project each unit is defined in units per hours. 

<h4>Organizational procedures links: </h4> 
<p>We refer to the WBS component used for project. Each component in WBS is assigned to the control account (CA). Each control account is often assigned a unique user id and password that is used in the organization’s accounting system. Team members will use unique codes to refer particular control account.</p> 

<h4>Rules of performance measurement:</h4>  

-  Earned value Management is used to measure cost performance. 
-  It focuses on tracking planned cost verses actual cost. 
-  It provides the importance of completed data percentage to do cost calculations. 
-  Most of the IT Projects don’t have good information about planning. So it is good to track actual progress verses planned one. Which leads us to the where project is lagging and how much extra amount is needed to finish the project successfully. 



<h4>Reporting formats:</h4> 

-  This section describes the format and frequency of cost reports required for the project. 
-  This section would describe the format and frequency of cost reports required for the project. 
-  Reports are very useful for tracking progress and success of projects. 
-  Selecting of cost reporting formats plays an important role to display reports.
-  It is better to use good reporting formats to display cost information effectively. 

<h4>Control thresholds:</h4> 
 -  Change requests during programming might increase the project budget than estimated cost. 
 -  Fixing the bugs during the development could cost more than the estimated cost. 
 -  10 percent of Variance allowed. 


<h4>Control thresholds:</h4> 


 -  Change requests during programming might increase the project budget than estimated cost. 
 -  Fixing the bugs during the development could cost more than the estimated cost.

### Review Cycles:

<p>“A Guide to Project Management”(GPM) consists of Video lectures, Quiz application,  Score Board, Forum for discussion, database development and Content development  are embedded in a complex system. This allow each area of GPM to be presented at different levels of detail in a web-based user interface. It is essential that each GPM area receive appropriate review prior to being deployed on the public GPM web site. These reviews will be performed for each of the area (that is, Content Development, database development, Statistical analysis tools, user interface, and integration tools). A standard series of reviews are available for each category, and these can be applied to each GPM area during the review process.</p>

### Technical Guidance:

<p>The quality objective for the technical guidance is to provide appropriate guidance using consistent and standard terminology. Quality objectives for the technical guidance will be met through internal and external peer review by appropriate specialist(s) as determined.</p>

1.  Does the content use consistent and standard technical terminology?

1.  Does the guidance present appropriate interpretation of Management concepts?

1.  Is user interface easy to accessible to everyone?

1.  Is key mythology explained adequately for the purpose and reaching expectation of the website?

1.  Is the website user friendly?

1.  Do you have any other comments on the technical guidance found in GPM ?

### Databases

<p>The quality objective for the database searches is to produce accurate and expected results. Search results are presented in a form that meets the user’s information needs. Databases for . GPM will be managed by MySQL. Database queries will be performed using MySQL queries Java or Javascript. Quiz question and and videos will be presented in the user's browsers in an HTML table</p>

<p>The quality expectations of the databases will be assessed by answering each of the following questions:</p>

1.  Are the database search results appropriate and accurate given the user input?
1.  Do the database search results appear to be comprehensive given the database disclaimer?
1.  Is the presentation of results user friendly?
1.  Are hyperlinks in the results table active and appropriate?
1.  Do you have any other comments on the databases found in GPM?

## Resource Assumptions


<p>Assumptions Common to Managers in Organizations Using the Human Relations Model:</p>


1.  Employee satisfaction is the key to productivity and quality
1.  Open supportive communication enhances satisfaction
1.  Meeting the individual needs of employees is a key goal of management
1.  Managers need to pay close attention to building good relationships on the job
1.  Employees will be motivated to do good work if the work environment permits it.

<h3>Keys to Good Human Relations/Resources in the Organization</h3>


1.  Good Communication - redundancy, informal networks, few barriers
1.  Clear Performance Goals facilitated with feedback, quick and specific
1.  Meaningful Rewards linked to performance
1.  and a Culture (esp. at mid and upper levels) 

## Resource Risk and Mitigation Strategies


<p>Inadequately trained and/or inexperienced project manager often increases the risk that the project will fail. Similarly, not having the right number of people (or lack of appropriate skill sets) is another common factor influencing the failure of many projects.
Skilled resources who can provide subject matter expertise for the tasks or deliverables assigned to them are a fundamental ingredient of a successful project. However, a “skilled resource” has not only the appropriate technical credentials, but interpersonal skills as well. The ability to communicate (both in writing and verbally) and to work well with others in a team environment is important. A skilled resource who cannot (or sometimes will not) communicate or work well with others can often pose a greater risk to the project than if no resource were available.</p>
