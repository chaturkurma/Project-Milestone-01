# 5. **Project Cost Management**

-  To create the Plan Cost Management, necessary inputs are required such as Project Management Plan, Project Charter, Enterprise Environmental factors and Organizational Process.  
-  The main advantage of this process is that it gives guidance as well as direction on how the project costs should be managed all throughout the implementation of the project.

<h4>Project Cost Management Process:</h4>


1.	Planning Cost Management
1.	Estimating the Costs
1.	Determining the Budgets
1.	Controlling the cost


<h4>Cost Management Plan includes following </h4>

<h4>Level of accuracy: </h4> 

-  Activity cost is rounded to nearest values for better calculations. 
-  Level of accuracy for activity cost and contingency funds is 90 percent. 

<h4>Units of measure:</h4>  

-  In this project each unit is defined in units per hours. 

<h4>Organizational procedures links: </h4> 
<p>We refer to the WBS component used for project. Each component in WBS is assigned to the control account (CA). Each control account is often assigned a unique user id and password that is used in the organization’s accounting system. Team members will use unique codes to refer particular control account.</p> 

<h4>Rules of performance measurement:</h4>  

-  Earned value Management is used to measure cost performance. 
-  It focuses on tracking planned cost verses actual cost. 
-  It provides the importance of completed data percentage to do cost calculations. 
-  Most of the IT Projects don’t have good information about planning. So it is good to track actual progress verses planned one. Which leads us to the where project is lagging and how much extra amount is needed to finish the project successfully. 



<h4>Reporting formats:</h4> 

-  This section describes the format and frequency of cost reports required for the project. 
-  This section would describe the format and frequency of cost reports required for the project. 
-  Reports are very useful for tracking progress and success of projects. 
-  Selecting of cost reporting formats plays an important role to display reports.
-  It is better to use good reporting formats to display cost information effectively. 

<h4>Control thresholds:</h4> 
 -  Change requests during programming might increase the project budget than estimated cost. 
 -  Fixing the bugs during the development could cost more than the estimated cost. 
 -  10 percent of Variance allowed.

## Resource Assumptions


<p>Assumptions Common to Managers in Organizations Using the Human Relations Model:</p>


1.  Employee satisfaction is the key to productivity and quality
1.  Open supportive communication enhances satisfaction
1.  Meeting the individual needs of employees is a key goal of management
1.  Managers need to pay close attention to building good relationships on the job
1.  Employees will be motivated to do good work if the work environment permits it.

<h3>Keys to Good Human Relations/Resources in the Organization</h3>


1.  Good Communication - redundancy, informal networks, few barriers
1.  Clear Performance Goals facilitated with feedback, quick and specific
1.  Meaningful Rewards linked to performance
1.  and a Culture (esp. at mid and upper levels) 

## Resource Risk and Mitigation Strategies


<p>Inadequately trained and/or inexperienced project manager often increases the risk that the project will fail. Similarly, not having the right number of people (or lack of appropriate skill sets) is another common factor influencing the failure of many projects.
Skilled resources who can provide subject matter expertise for the tasks or deliverables assigned to them are a fundamental ingredient of a successful project. However, a “skilled resource” has not only the appropriate technical credentials, but interpersonal skills as well. The ability to communicate (both in writing and verbally) and to work well with others in a team environment is important. A skilled resource who cannot (or sometimes will not) communicate or work well with others can often pose a greater risk to the project than if no resource were available.</p>

# 9. Project Risk Management

<p>This section is not suggesting that threats to the project will happen. A risk management plan is to help the project’s stakeholders aware of possible threats and be assured that the project team has sufficient and efficient means of risk mitigation.</p>


<p>The project team is working under a tight schedule and the website and quiz application is to be catered and appeal to a diverse group of users from cycling enthusiasts to parents and their children. Under these circumstances and the nature of website development projects, this section will describe project risks that could affect the project’s performance in terms of completing the scope and delivering the project on time and on budget.</p>


## Risk management approach 


<p>The approach the project team has taken to manage risks for this project includes a systematic process by which the project team identified and ranked the various identified project
risks.</p>

<p>The most probable and highest impact risks were added to the project schedule to ensure that the risk managers (Project Manager and Tech Lead) takes the necessary actions to mitigate these risks at the appropriate time as the project progresses.</p>.

<p>Part of our project schedule is a weekly meeting for the Project Manager and his team to provide status updates on their assigned risk to the project sponsor, and if necessary, provide an executive summary to keep the project’s stakeholders informed.</p

<p>Upon the completion of the project, the project team will analyze each identified risk and the adopted risk management process. Based on this analysis, the team will identify any improvements that can ameliorate the risk management process for future projects. These improvements will also be recorded into the Ace IT Consultancy’s existing knowledge base.</p>

## Roles and responsibilities

Project manager and Team lead are the responsible persons to handle the Risks. Project manager monitors project risk and setup the mitigation strategies. Project manager will communicate all the risk to the stakeholders and team members. Team lead and members will continue to work the on the project managers mitigation strategies.

## Identifying risks:

Following we have Determined the process we have followed while identifying the possible risks. 

### Risk Assessment Meeting:


<p> A meeting was organized with in the team members, few senior web programmers and with anticipated user of the website. As one of our team members facilitating this meeting, we have conducted a brainstorming session.  As psychology literature shows that individuals produce a greater number of ideas working alone than they do through brainstorming in small, face-to-face groups. We have used the initial 15mins in the meeting for this. Following we have read put load and discussed the possible risks. In addition to contributing ideas to meeting, project manager also worked on taking notes of the all the risk have mentioned in the projects. </p>

<p>Later project manager categorized risks identified during the meeting were put into the project plan and risk management. </p>

### Historical review of similar projects:


<p>Our team reviewed most of the similar projects available over the web to find the common risks and strategies used to mitigate the risks. </p>


### List of the possible Risks:

### Top three risks:



The top three high probability and high impact risks to this project are:


  ### Huge change requests late in the project


<p>If stakeholders decide to add to the original functional and design requirements or make major changes to the way parts of the site is programmed/designed to function, it will result in delaying the project’s expected delivery and may even require a major overhaul of the website.</p>

<p>Potential response: Proper requirements analysis is to be done beforehand and scope statements must be signed and accepted by stakeholders and project sponsor. If huge changes are bound to happen, then setup prior mutual agreement with stakeholders that any major changes proposed 2-3 weeks before the testing phase may be accepted but there might be a delay on delivery date and increase in budget. If major changes are proposed after testing, further negotiation of time and budget is needed.</p>



 ### Misunderstanding of the external team resources

<p>Content of the website will be created by the vendor. If the content developer delays the content than anticipated time. Project is going to get delayed until we receive the content and upload content into the database. Specifically, the videos and quiz questions material. If the content is not developed as per our requirement, the vendor may have to rework on that. Reworking on content is direct impacts on the project schedule.</p>


#### Potential response:  By arranging the meeting times early with the content developing team and continuous monitoring over the content development and frequent meetings with vendors will helps. 

### Lack of stakeholders’ involvement

<p>As the website is to provide specific functionalities and constructed with the latest web design trends, stakeholders’ involvement is crucial to the project team’s requirements analysis before the construction of the website. With the lack of stakeholders’ involvement, the project will not be able to finish on time and may fall short of the required project scope. </p>

<h4>Potential response:</h4>   The project sponsor is actively involved, and a clear communications plan will enable project team to speak to the right stakeholder with the right communication medium. On top of that, a weekly team meeting will surface any major errors in the project.



## Other Possible Risks 

### Overestimating project team’s abilities


<p>This will result in underestimating the project’s timeline and thus impact the project’s performance.</p>

<p>Potential response: Buffer time had been factored into the project and time consuming or content heavy software development modules had been outsourced to open-source or commercial software such as forum and community page content management.</p>

### Unexpected software abnormalities (“bugs”)


<p>Project team unable to discover or resolve software abnormalities in time will cause these abnormalities to escalate as the website develops further. This will pose a threat to the website’s completion being delayed or even cause the website to undergo over haul. These software abnormalities could be caused by human errors, hardware and software incompatibility or found in the development tools used by the project team.</p>

<h4>Potential response:</h4>    The project team has two good programmers. Moreover, If any problem arise while working will reach out to third party consultant to resolve that problem with put any delay. Lastly, according to our budget forecast, the project team has ample amount of budget to seek external senior programmers if needed.

### Key project team member sick/urgent leave/quits


<p>One of our key project team members is the web programmer who doubles up as the Tech Lead. Without the key players, the project will suffer huge delays. </p>

#### Potential response:     <p>Adequate buffer time had been added into the project’s schedule and fortunately by 6 weeks into the project, other programmers should be freed up to assist. If not, according to our budget forecast, the project team has ample amount of budget to seek external senior programmers if needed.</p>

#### Over-emphasis on low priority details


<p>Requirements for the website should be identified as being Low Priority and High Priority. Low Priority requirements are website details that can easily be changed, or "would be nice to have" if time and budget allows. High priority requirements are time-consuming, difficult to change and is a "must have". A delay will happen if project team fixates on low priority requirements, for example spending too much time on the colors of a certain web page.
Potential response: The project team adopts a feature-driven approach in developing the website and project requirements and analysis were discussed, signed by stakeholders early in the project phase. The project team does the designing of web graphics and developing of backend technologies in parallel in order to spend more time in integrating the design with backend technologies. On top of that, the project team allocated a required buffer time. </p>

## Risk mitigation

<p>As more project risks are identified throughout the project, they will be accessed by the Project Manager and Team Lead, and together with the project team will develop avoidance and mitigation strategies. These risks are used to update the Risk Register and the risk management plan to ensure these risks are being monitored in timely fashion and are responded to accordingly.</p>
<p>Both identified and future occurring project risks will be managed and controlled within the constraints of time, scope, and cost. The Project Manager, with the assistance of the Teamlead will determine the best way to respond to each risk to ensure compliance with these constraints. In worst case scenarios it may be necessary to allow flexibility to one of the project’s constraints. If necessary, funding may be added to the project to allow for more resources in order to meet the project schedule and scope requirements. Time and scope are rigid project constraints and no flexibility. However, cost constraint will only be allowed to be flexible in extreme cases where no other risk avoidance or mitigation strategy will work.</p>

##	Procurement Management Plan
This document was made after the successful planning of the procurement by considering the major inputs like scope baseline, documentation of requirements, team agreement, risk register, activity resource requirement, the project schedule, cost estimates, cost performance baselines, and organizational process assets
## i. Statement of Work 
### I.	Scope of Work:
To upgrade the platform for transportation systems, with the increase in demand for mobile applications the organization has decided to start applications on both Android and iOS for their systems. We need to upgrade their equipment (software/hardware) to start mobile development. 

Two different team needs to be assigned. One for upgrading the software in the iOS environment and another in the Android environment. One team should work on the hardware integration and upgradation. It should be handled by single project manager. The tester will test the compatibility of the modules once a portion or module is completed and again test the combination of module and if they still cause no error while working together. The quality assurance team will check the application platform for if it is within the quality guidelines of the company and developing environment.
The hardware part involves desktops for windows-based desktops for android developers and other staff, Mac’s for iOS developers, laptops for top level management officials, printers, Xerox machines for taking photocopies of required documents. iPads for testing the iOS application, nexus tabs for testing android application. These software will be provided  by our team, software involves window operating system for desktops, java 8.1 version for android, XCode for developing the application for iPhones, selenium for testing both android and iOS applications, oracle for database, android studio, SQL for database, outlook for communication, and WhatsApp group for instant messages Skype for conference calls.

### II.	Location of Work:
Most of the work must be performed in the office because it is related to upgrading the existing platform. The hardware and software will be from the same building where the work must be performed. Workstation will be used as specified in our proposal. 
The work will consist of
•	5  cubicles 
•	1 conference room 
•	1 server and database maintenance place will also be allocated. 
•	The project staff and management will be working at their own designated workplace hence there won’t be requirement of any transport facility. The participating company for outsourcing will also be considered as part of this company. 

### III.	Period of Performance:
The project commences from July 6th, 2019 expected to be finished by August 9th, 2019. The project must be completed within the schedule. The actual upgradation work starts from July 16th, 2018. During this period the older platform and new hardware will be reviewed and documented. The working hours per day is 8 and an extra hour if required. This work should be strictly done in the office premises.

### IV.	Period of Performance:
