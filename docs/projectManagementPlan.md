<h1>Cost Management Plan</h1>
<h4>
- To create the Plan Cost Management, necessary inputs are required such as Project Management Plan, Project Charter, Enterprise Environmental factors and Organizational Process.  
- The main advantage of this process is that it gives guidance as well as direction on how the project costs should be managed all throughout the implementation of the project.
