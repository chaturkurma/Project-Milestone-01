# Project Procurement Management	
##	Procurement Management Plan
This document was made after the successful planning of the procurement by considering the major inputs like scope baseline, documentation of requirements, team agreement, risk register, activity resource requirement, the project schedule, cost estimates, cost performance baselines, and organizational process assets
## i. Statement of Work 
### I.	Scope of Work:
To upgrade the platform for transportation systems, with the increase in demand for mobile applications the organization has decided to start applications on both Android and iOS for their systems. We need to upgrade their equipment (software/hardware) to start mobile development. 

Two different team needs to be assigned. One for upgrading the software in the iOS environment and another in the Android environment. One team should work on the hardware integration and upgradation. It should be handled by single project manager. The tester will test the compatibility of the modules once a portion or module is completed and again test the combination of module and if they still cause no error while working together. The quality assurance team will check the application platform for if it is within the quality guidelines of the company and developing environment.
The hardware part involves desktops for windows-based desktops for android developers and other staff, Mac’s for iOS developers, laptops for top level management officials, printers, Xerox machines for taking photocopies of required documents. iPads for testing the iOS application, nexus tabs for testing android application. These software will be provided  by our team, software involves window operating system for desktops, java 8.1 version for android, XCode for developing the application for iPhones, selenium for testing both android and iOS applications, oracle for database, android studio, SQL for database, outlook for communication, and WhatsApp group for instant messages Skype for conference calls.

### II.	Location of Work:
Most of the work must be performed in the office because it is related to upgrading the existing platform. The hardware and software will be from the same building where the work must be performed. Workstation will be used as specified in our proposal. 
The work will consist of
•	5  cubicles 
•	1 conference room 
•	1 server and database maintenance place will also be allocated. 
•	The project staff and management will be working at their own designated workplace hence there won’t be requirement of any transport facility. The participating company for outsourcing will also be considered as part of this company. 

### III.	Period of Performance:
The project commences from July 6th, 2019 expected to be finished by August 9th, 2019. The project must be completed within the schedule. The actual upgradation work starts from July 16th, 2018. During this period the older platform and new hardware will be reviewed and documented. The working hours per day is 8 and an extra hour if required. This work should be strictly done in the office premises.
