<h2>Project Risk Management</h2>

<p>This section is not suggesting that threats to the project will happen. A risk management plan is to help the project’s stakeholders aware of possible threats and be assured that the project team has sufficient and efficient means of risk mitigation.</p>


<p>The project team is working under a tight schedule and the website and quiz application is to be catered and appeal to a diverse group of users from cycling enthusiasts to parents and their children. Under these circumstances and the nature of website development projects, this section will describe project risks that could affect the project’s performance in terms of completing the scope and delivering the project on time and on budget.</p>


<h2>Risk management approach</h2>


<p>The approach the project team has taken to manage risks for this project includes a systematic process by which the project team identified and ranked the various identified project
risks.</p>

<p>The most probable and highest impact risks were added to the project schedule to ensure that the risk managers (Project Manager and Tech Lead) takes the necessary actions to mitigate these risks at the appropriate time as the project progresses.</p>.

<p>Part of our project schedule is a weekly meeting for the Project Manager and his team to provide status updates on their assigned risk to the project sponsor, and if necessary, provide an executive summary to keep the project’s stakeholders informed.</p

<p>Upon the completion of the project, the project team will analyze each identified risk and the adopted risk management process. Based on this analysis, the team will identify any improvements that can ameliorate the risk management process for future projects. These improvements will also be recorded into the Ace IT Consultancy’s existing knowledge base.</p>

<h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>

Project manager and Team lead are the responsible persons to handle the Risks. Project manager monitors project risk and setup the mitigation strategies. Project manager will communicate all the risk to the stakeholders and team members. Team lead and members will continue to work the on the project managers mitigation strategies.

<h2>Identifying risks:</h2>

Following we have Determined the process we have followed while identifying the possible risks. 

<h3>Risk Assessment Meeting:</h3>


<p> A meeting was organized with in the team members, few senior web programmers and with anticipated user of the website. As one of our team members facilitating this meeting, we have conducted a brainstorming session.  As psychology literature shows that individuals produce a greater number of ideas working alone than they do through brainstorming in small, face-to-face groups. We have used the initial 15mins in the meeting for this. Following we have read put load and discussed the possible risks. In addition to contributing ideas to meeting, project manager also worked on taking notes of the all the risk have mentioned in the projects. </p>

<p>Later project manager categorized risks identified during the meeting were put into the project plan and risk management. </p>

<h3>Historical review of similar projects:</h3> 


<p>Our team reviewed most of the similar projects available over the web to find the common risks and strategies used to mitigate the risks. </p>


<h3>List of the possible Risks:</h3> 

<h4>Top three risks:</h4>


The top three high probability and high impact risks to this project are:

<h3>Huge change requests late in the project</h3>


<p>If stakeholders decide to add to the original functional and design requirements or make major changes to the way parts of the site is programmed/designed to function, it will result in delaying the project’s expected delivery and may even require a major overhaul of the website.</p>

<p>Potential response: Proper requirements analysis is to be done beforehand and scope statements must be signed and accepted by stakeholders and project sponsor. If huge changes are bound to happen, then setup prior mutual agreement with stakeholders that any major changes proposed 2-3 weeks before the testing phase may be accepted but there might be a delay on delivery date and increase in budget. If major changes are proposed after testing, further negotiation of time and budget is needed.</p>



<h3>Misunderstanding of the external team resources</h3>

<p>Content of the website will be created by the vendor. If the content developer delays the content than anticipated time. Project is going to get delayed until we receive the content and upload content into the database. Specifically, the videos and quiz questions material. If the content is not developed as per our requirement, the vendor may have to rework on that. Reworking on content is direct impacts on the project schedule.</p>


<h4>Potential response:</h4>   By arranging the meeting times early with the content developing team and continuous monitoring over the content development and frequent meetings with vendors will helps. 

<h3>Lack of stakeholders’ involvement</h3>

<p>As the website is to provide specific functionalities and constructed with the latest web design trends, stakeholders’ involvement is crucial to the project team’s requirements analysis before the construction of the website. With the lack of stakeholders’ involvement, the project will not be able to finish on time and may fall short of the required project scope. </p>

<h4>Potential response:</h4>   The project sponsor is actively involved, and a clear communications plan will enable project team to speak to the right stakeholder with the right communication medium. On top of that, a weekly team meeting will surface any major errors in the project.

<h3>Overestimating project team’s abilities</h3>


<p>This will result in underestimating the project’s timeline and thus impact the project’s performance.</p>

<p>Potential response: Buffer time had been factored into the project and time consuming or content heavy software development modules had been outsourced to open-source or commercial software such as forum and community page content management.</p>

<h3>Unexpected software abnormalities (“bugs”)</h3>


<p>Project team unable to discover or resolve software abnormalities in time will cause these abnormalities to escalate as the website develops further. This will pose a threat to the website’s completion being delayed or even cause the website to undergo over haul. These software abnormalities could be caused by human errors, hardware and software incompatibility or found in the development tools used by the project team.</p>

<h4>Potential response:</h4>    The project team has two good programmers. Moreover, If any problem arise while working will reach out to third party consultant to resolve that problem with put any delay. Lastly, according to our budget forecast, the project team has ample amount of budget to seek external senior programmers if needed.

<h3>Key project team member sick/urgent leave/quits</h3>


<p>One of our key project team members is the web programmer who doubles up as the Tech Lead. Without the key players, the project will suffer huge delays. </p>

<h4>Potential response:</h4>     <p>Adequate buffer time had been added into the project’s schedule and fortunately by 6 weeks into the project, other programmers should be freed up to assist. If not, according to our budget forecast, the project team has ample amount of budget to seek external senior programmers if needed.</p>

<h3>Over-emphasis on low priority details</h3>


<p>Requirements for the website should be identified as being Low Priority and High Priority. Low Priority requirements are website details that can easily be changed, or "would be nice to have" if time and budget allows. High priority requirements are time-consuming, difficult to change and is a "must have". A delay will happen if project team fixates on low priority requirements, for example spending too much time on the colors of a certain web page.
Potential response: The project team adopts a feature-driven approach in developing the website and project requirements and analysis were discussed, signed by stakeholders early in the project phase. The project team does the designing of web graphics and developing of backend technologies in parallel in order to spend more time in integrating the design with backend technologies. On top of that, the project team allocated a required buffer time. </p>

<h2>Risk mitigation</h2>

<p>As more project risks are identified throughout the project, they will be accessed by the Project Manager and Team Lead, and together with the project team will develop avoidance and mitigation strategies. These risks are used to update the Risk Register and the risk management plan to ensure these risks are being monitored in timely fashion and are responded to accordingly.</p>
<p>Both identified and future occurring project risks will be managed and controlled within the constraints of time, scope, and cost. The Project Manager, with the assistance of the Teamlead will determine the best way to respond to each risk to ensure compliance with these constraints. In worst case scenarios it may be necessary to allow flexibility to one of the project’s constraints. If necessary, funding may be added to the project to allow for more resources in order to meet the project schedule and scope requirements. Time and scope are rigid project constraints and no flexibility. However, cost constraint will only be allowed to be flexible in extreme cases where no other risk avoidance or mitigation strategy will work.</p>
